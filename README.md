Wealthsimple
Overview and Origin:
Wealthsimple is a Canadian-based online investment management service that was founded in September 2014 by Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt, and Rudy Adler. It was started with a vision of making investing accessible to everyone by providing an easy-to-use and affordable online investment management service. The platform offers a user-friendly interface, low minimum investment amounts, and a range of investment options, including socially responsible investing.
Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt, and Rudy Adler recognized that traditional financial institutions were directly for the younger generation, tech-savvy investors who wanted an easier, more affordable way to invest. They were the first Canadian company to see the opportunity in this sector and utilize that to build a platform that was convenient for everyone to use. 
The founders of Wealthsimple were all experienced in the financial industry. Michael Katchen was a former executive at the online investing service, 1000Memories, and Brett Huneycutt had worked at the online brokerage, Zecco.

The founders also took inspiration from the popularity of robo-advisors in the US market and thought that a similar business model would work well in Canada. By providing an openly accessible online investment management service, they saw an opportunity to upend Canada's established investment landscape.
Before launching Wealthsimple in September 2014, the founders devoted months to market research and business plan development. Since then, the business has experienced rapid growth and has turned into one of Canada's and other countries' most popular online investment management services.

Conclusion:
If I were to advise Wealthsimple, I would suggest that they expand their offerings to include financial planning services. While they do provide investment management services, they could benefit from offering a more comprehensive suite of financial services to their clients.
Financial planning services would allow Wealthsimple to better serve clients who may be interested in setting goals and developing a roadmap for achieving them. These services could include retirement planning, estate planning, tax planning, and more.
By expanding their services to include financial planning, Wealthsimple would be able to attract and retain clients who are looking for a more holistic approach to their finances. This could be particularly beneficial for high net worth individuals who may require more complex financial planning strategies.
To implement these services, Wealthsimple would need to leverage technology to streamline the financial planning process. This could include the use of algorithms to generate customized financial plans based on a client's unique goals and financial situation. They could also use online tools to allow clients to track their progress towards their goals and make adjustments as needed.
These technologies are appropriate for Wealthsimple because they align with the company's existing strengths in leveraging technology to deliver innovative financial services. By offering financial planning services, Wealthsimple could differentiate itself from competitors and position itself as a one-stop-shop for all of a client's financial needs.
