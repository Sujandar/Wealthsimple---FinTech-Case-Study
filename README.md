# Wealthsimple

## Overview and Origin:

Wealthsimple is a Canadian-based online investment management service that was founded in September 2014 by Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt, and Rudy Adler. It was started with a vision of making investing accessible to everyone by providing an easy-to-use and affordable online investment management service. The platform offers a user-friendly interface, low minimum investment amounts, and a range of investment options, including socially responsible investing.

The idea for Wealthsimple came about when its founders, Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt, and Rudy Adler, recognized that traditional financial institutions were not serving younger, tech-savvy investors who wanted an easier, more affordable way to invest. They saw an opportunity to provide a modern investment platform that would make investing more accessible to everyone.

The founders of Wealthsimple were all experienced in the financial industry. Michael Katchen was a former executive at the online investing service, 1000Memories, and Brett Huneycutt had worked at the online brokerage, Zecco. Rudy Adler had worked as a writer for The Huffington Post and co-founded the crowdfunding site, Amicus.

The three founders recognized that there was a significant gap in the market for a modern, easy-to-use, and affordable investment platform that would cater to the needs of younger, tech-savvy investors. They believed that by providing a platform that was simple to use, offered low fees, and a range of investment options, they could attract a new generation of investors who were looking for a more modern and affordable investment experience.

The founders were also inspired by the success of robo-advisors in the US market and believed that a similar model could be successful in Canada. They saw an opportunity to disrupt the traditional investment industry in Canada by offering an online investment management service that would be accessible to everyone.

The founders spent several months researching the market and developing their business plan before launching Wealthsimple in September 2014. Since then, the company has grown rapidly and has become one of the most successful online investment management services in Canada and beyond.

Wealthsimple has raised a total of CAD $485 million in funding since its launch in 2014. The company has received funding from a variety of sources, including venture capital firms, strategic investors, and financial institutions.

The company's first funding round was led by Power Financial Corporation, a financial holding company, which invested CAD $10 million in Wealthsimple in 2015. The following year, Wealthsimple raised CAD $20 million in a funding round led by Allianz X, the digital investment arm of the German insurance company, Allianz SE.

In 2017, Wealthsimple raised CAD $50 million in a funding round led by Power Financial Corporation, which also included participation from several other investors, including a subsidiary of the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings. Later that year, Wealthsimple raised an additional CAD $65 million in a funding round led by Power Financial Corporation and included participation from Allianz X and other investors.

In 2018, Wealthsimple raised CAD $100 million in a funding round led by Allianz X and Power Financial Corporation, which also included participation from other investors, such as the US-based venture capital firm, Greylock Partners.

In 2019, Wealthsimple raised CAD $100 million in a funding round led by the US-based technology investment firm, TCV. This funding round brought Wealthsimple's total valuation to CAD $1.4 billion, making it one of Canada's most valuable fintech startups.

Wealthsimple has also received funding from other sources, such as the National Bank of Canada and the investment management firm, Holtzbrinck Ventures.

Overall, the significant amount of funding raised by Wealthsimple has enabled the company to expand its product offerings, enter new markets, and accelerate its growth.

## Business Activities:

Wealthsimple's mission is to democratize access to financial services and provide a modern, easy-to-use, and affordable investment platform for everyone. The company aims to solve several financial problems that are common among traditional financial institutions.

One specific financial problem that Wealthsimple is trying to solve is the lack of accessibility to investment products and services for younger, tech-savvy investors. Traditional investment firms often have high fees, complex investment products, and require a minimum investment amount, making it difficult for younger and less wealthy investors to participate in the markets. Wealthsimple aims to provide a user-friendly and accessible investment platform that allows anyone to invest regardless of their wealth or knowledge level.

Another problem Wealthsimple is trying to solve is the lack of transparency and trust in the financial industry. Wealthsimple aims to provide a transparent and honest investment platform by offering clear and concise information about their fees, investment strategies, and performance. The company believes that transparency and honesty are crucial to building trust with customers and fostering long-term relationships.

Lastly, Wealthsimple aims to provide an affordable investment platform by offering low fees compared to traditional financial institutions. The company's low fees are possible because of its technology-driven business model, which allows it to automate many investment processes, reducing costs and passing on those savings to customers. Wealthsimple's low fees make investing accessible to more people and enable customers to keep more of their returns.

Overall, Wealthsimple is trying to solve several financial problems, including lack of accessibility, transparency, trust, and affordability, by providing a modern, easy-to-use, and low-cost investment platform for everyone.

The company offers a user-friendly platform with a low minimum investment amount, low fees, and a range of investment options, including socially responsible investing. Wealthsimple is one of the few online investment management services that offer socially responsible investing. Wealthsimple offers additional services like tax-loss harvesting and financial planning.

Wealthsimple uses a variety of technologies to power its investment platform and provide a seamless user experience. Some of the key technologies that the company utilizes include:

1) Cloud Computing - Wealthsimple leverages cloud computing technology to power its platform. The company uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store and manage its data, run its applications, and scale its infrastructure as needed. This allows Wealthsimple to quickly and efficiently handle large volumes of transactions and data while providing a secure and reliable platform for its customers.

2) Data Analytics - Wealthsimple uses data analytics to analyze customer behavior and investment trends to provide personalized investment advice and recommendations. The company uses machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data, identify investment opportunities, and optimize its investment strategies.

3) Mobile Technology - Wealthsimple has a mobile app that allows customers to manage their investments on the go. The app provides real-time investment tracking, alerts, and notifications, allowing customers to stay up-to-date on their investments.

4) Robo-Advisory Technology - Wealthsimple's investment platform is powered by robo-advisory technology, which uses algorithms and automation to provide investment advice and manage customer portfolios. The technology allows Wealthsimple to offer personalized investment recommendations based on customer goals, risk tolerance, and other factors.

5) Blockchain - Wealthsimple has also explored the use of blockchain technology for investment management. The company has experimented with using blockchain to create a more secure and transparent platform for investment management, although it has not yet implemented this technology on a large scale.

## Recommendations:

Wealthsimple has had a significant impact on the investment industry since its founding in 2014. As of 2021, the company manages over $10 billion in assets and has over 1.5 million customers in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The company's growth has been driven by its innovative technology, user-friendly platform, and commitment to socially responsible investing.

One of Wealthsimple's key strengths is its ability to appeal to a younger demographic of investors who are comfortable with technology and value simplicity and transparency. The company has been successful in attracting millennial and Gen Z investors who may not have had access to traditional financial services in the past.

Wealthsimple's impact on the investment industry can also be seen in its commitment to socially responsible investing. The company offers a range of investment products that prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, as well as a Halal portfolio designed for Muslim investors. This focus on socially responsible investing has resonated with customers and helped to differentiate Wealthsimple from its competitors.

Some of the key metrics that companies in the investment management domain use to measure success include:

Assets under management (AUM) - This refers to the total value of assets that a company manages on behalf of its customers.

Customer acquisition and retention - This includes metrics such as the number of new customers acquired, customer churn rate, and customer satisfaction.

Revenue and profitability - This includes metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins, and return on investment.

Investment performance - This includes metrics such as the performance of the company's investment products relative to benchmarks and competitors.

Wealthsimple has performed strongly across all of these metrics. As of 2021, the company manages over $10 billion in AUM, and its customer base has grown rapidly, with over 1.5 million customers across multiple countries. The company has also been profitable, with strong revenue growth and healthy profit margins. Additionally, Wealthsimple's investment products have generally performed well, with many outperforming their respective benchmarks.

Wealthsimple is a major player in the investment management industry, and it competes with a range of other companies that offer similar products and services. In terms of assets under management, Wealthsimple is smaller than some of its larger competitors, such as Vanguard and Fidelity Investments. However, the company has been able to carve out a niche for itself by targeting a younger demographic of investors and emphasizing socially responsible investing.

Wealthsimple's user-friendly platform and commitment to transparency have also helped it stand out from its competitors. The company has won numerous awards for its design and user experience, and its focus on education and financial literacy has helped to build customer loyalty.

In terms of investment performance, Wealthsimple has generally performed well relative to its peers. While there are certainly other investment products and services that may outperform Wealthsimple's offerings, the company's commitment to low fees and diversified portfolios has helped to generate strong returns for its customers. Overall, Wealthsimple has established itself as a major player in the investment management industry, and its continued growth and success suggest that it will remain a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.

## Conclusion:

If I were to advise Wealthsimple, I would suggest that they expand their offerings to include financial planning services. While they do provide investment management services, they could benefit from offering a more comprehensive suite of financial services to their clients.

Financial planning services would allow Wealthsimple to better serve clients who may be interested in setting goals and developing a roadmap for achieving them. These services could include retirement planning, estate planning, tax planning, and more.

By expanding their services to include financial planning, Wealthsimple would be able to attract and retain clients who are looking for a more holistic approach to their finances. This could be particularly beneficial for high net worth individuals who may require more complex financial planning strategies.

To implement these services, Wealthsimple would need to leverage technology to streamline the financial planning process. This could include the use of algorithms to generate customized financial plans based on a client's unique goals and financial situation. They could also use online tools to allow clients to track their progress towards their goals and make adjustments as needed.

These technologies are appropriate for Wealthsimple because they align with the company's existing strengths in leveraging technology to deliver innovative financial services. By offering financial planning services, Wealthsimple could differentiate itself from competitors and position itself as a one-stop-shop for all of a client's financial needs.
