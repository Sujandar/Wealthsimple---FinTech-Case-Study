# Wealthsimple 

## Overview and Origin

Wealthsimple is a Canadian-based online investment management service that was founded in September 2014 by Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt, and Rudy Adler. It was started with a vision of making investing accessible to everyone by providing an easy-to-use and affordable online investment management service. The platform offers a user-friendly interface, low minimum investment amounts, and a range of investment options, including socially responsible investing. 

Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt, and Rudy Adler recognized that traditional financial institutions were directly for the younger generation, tech-savvy investors who wanted an easier, more affordable way to invest. They were the first Canadian company to see the opportunity in this sector and utilize that to build a platform that was convenient for everyone to use. 
The founders of Wealthsimple were all experienced in the financial industry. Michael Katchen was a former executive at the online investing service, 1000Memories, and Brett Huneycutt had worked at the online brokerage, Zecco. Rudy Adler had worked as a writer for The Huffington Post and co-founded the crowdfunding site, Amicus. 

The founders also took inspiration from the popularity of robo-advisors in the US market and thought that a similar business model would work well in Canada. By providing an openly accessible online investment management service, they saw an opportunity to upend Canada's established investment landscape. 
Before launching Wealthsimple in September 2014, the founders devoted months to market research and business plan development. Since then, the business has experienced rapid growth and has turned into one of Canada's and other countries' most popular online investment management services.

Wealthsimple has raised a total of CAD $485 million in funding since it was incorporated in September 2014. Diverse funding sources, such as venture capital firms, strategic investors, and private equity firms, have helped the company. Wealthsimple has also received funding from other sources, such as the National Bank of Canada and the investment management firm, Holtzbrinck Ventures.
